# SALT incentives

Here are a few ways that you can earn SALT

**Bug fixing**

If you find a bug in our code, let us know, submit a PR in one of our repos [github.com/saltswap](https://github.com/saltswap) and we will pay you when your code is merged.

Please read how to contribute in our guide in the repo's README.

**Designer?**

Create a sticker pack for Telegram, the top 3 most voted will earn a big chunk of SALT rewards.

**Do you speak a language other than English?**

Open a local SALT community in your local language on Telegram and we will fund you.

**Community manager**

Would you like to keep the channel clean of spam and help answer questions from the community?

We are opening a community manager role. We will pay you in SALT.

**Twitter**

We will be launching random drafts on twitter ([@SaltSwap](https://twitter.com/SaltSwap)), follow us, like and retweet our tweets and you might win a few SALTs.
