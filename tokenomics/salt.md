**Deflationary Mechanics:**

- 9.09% will be sent to the developer's address for further development of the platform;
- Farms & pools will get corresponding SALT depending on the multiplier shown on the top left corner;
- 20% of lottery pot is burned.

**Distribution:**

- **Farmers -** 100% of the rewards per block \(1 SALT\)
- **Farmers daily -** 30,000 SALT \(based on 30k blocks per day\)

**Fees:**

SaltSwap collects a 3% deposit fee to periodically purchase SALT on the market and burn them. This will reduce the supply and pump your bags!

**Time lock**

We will be adding a timelock contract as the owner of the masterchef. The timelock will be activated with a _24h delay_, this should give you enough time to validate any of our transactions.
