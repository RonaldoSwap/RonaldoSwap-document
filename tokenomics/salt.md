**Fees:**

SaltSwap collects a 3% deposit fee to periodically purchase SALT on the market and burn them. This will reduce the supply and pump your bags!

**Time lock**

We will be adding a timelock contract as the owner of the masterchef. The timelock will be activated with a _24h delay_, this should give you enough time to validate any of our transactions.
