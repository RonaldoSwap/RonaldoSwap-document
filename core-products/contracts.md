# Contracts

Our contracts are publicly accessible in the following repo [github.com/saltswap/salt-contracts](https://github.com/saltswap/salt-contracts)

- **Timelock:** [0x11D1c539a1919D601ba85cC993665819FC6120d9](https://bscscan.com/address/0x11D1c539a1919D601ba85cC993665819FC6120d9) (delay: 24h)
- **MasterChef:** [0xda8010A34ED29430B0B7E25c84cbe409506CA05f](https://bscscan.com/address/0xda8010A34ED29430B0B7E25c84cbe409506CA05f)
- **SALT:** [0x2849b1aE7E04A3D9Bc288673A92477CF63F28aF4](https://bscscan.com/address/0x2849b1aE7E04A3D9Bc288673A92477CF63F28aF4)

**How are our contracts safe?**

We have based our implementation in Goose Finance's EGG token and have the following features:

- **24h** timelock added to contract at launch;
- No migrator code, it was totally removed;
- Contract audit in the pipeline.

**Removed migratator code**

Removed from PancakeSwap's [MasterChef.sol](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-farm/blob/master/contracts/MasterChef.sol)

```javascript
// Set the migrator contract. Can only be called by the owner.
function setMigrator(IMigratorChef _migrator) public onlyOwner {
    migrator = _migrator;
}

// Migrate lp token to another lp contract. Can be called by anyone. We trust that migrator contract is good.
function migrate(uint256 _pid) public {
    require(address(migrator) != address(0), "migrate: no migrator");
    PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
    IBEP20 lpToken = pool.lpToken;
    uint256 bal = lpToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    lpToken.safeApprove(address(migrator), bal);
    IBEP20 newLpToken = migrator.migrate(lpToken);
    require(bal == newLpToken.balanceOf(address(this)), "migrate: bad");
    pool.lpToken = newLpToken;
}
```
