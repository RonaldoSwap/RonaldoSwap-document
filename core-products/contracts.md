# Contracts

Our contracts are publicly accessible in the following repo [github.com/saltswap/salt-contracts](https://github.com/saltswap/salt-contracts)

**How are our contracts safe?**

We have based our implementation in Goose Finance's EGG token and have the following features:

- 24h timelock;
- No migrator code, it was totally removed;
- Contract audit in the pipeline.
